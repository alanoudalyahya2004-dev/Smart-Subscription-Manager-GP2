# Smart Subscription Manager

Smart Subscription Manager is a mobile application that helps users manage and optimize their subscription-based services using **Artificial Intelligence** and **FinTech** techniques.  
The application aims to reduce financial waste by detecting recurring subscriptions, tracking spending, and providing intelligent recommendations.

## Project Overview
With the increasing use of subscription services (e.g., Netflix, Spotify, Shahid, Udemy), many users lose track of renewal dates and continue paying for unused services.  
This project provides a unified platform to monitor subscriptions, analyze usage, and forecast future expenses.

## Key Features
- Manual subscription management and dashboard view  
- Automatic invoice extraction from **Gmail API**  
- NLP-based classification of subscription invoices  
- Budget tracking and renewal reminders  
- Usage vs. cost analysis using Screen Time data  
- AI-powered recommendations for renewal or cancellation  
- Time-series forecasting (LSTM) for future expenses  

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter (Dart)** – Mobile Application  
- **Node.js (Express.js)** – Backend REST API  
- **PostgreSQL (Hosted on Supabase)** – Database  
- **JWT** – Authentication  
- **Bcrypt** – Password Security  
- **AI/ML (NLP & LSTM)** – Intelligent Analytics
- **APIs** – Gmail API, Screen Time API
