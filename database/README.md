## Database Design

The Smart Subscription Manager database is built using PostgreSQL (Supabase) and is designed to support authentication, subscription management, analytics, and notification features.

The database includes the following tables:

	•	users
	•	profiles
	•	categories
	•	subscriptions
	•	notifications
	•	detected_services
	•	gmail_tokens
	•	scanned_emails
	•	screen_time_entries
	•	spending_history
	•	spending_predictions

The schema is managed using Prisma migrations, and the database is hosted on Supabase.
